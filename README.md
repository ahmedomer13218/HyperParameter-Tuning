### Overview  
This repository focuses on exploring hyperparameter tuning techniques for regression models. Starting with manual tuning, adjustments were made based on model performance, accuracy, and computation time. Automation tools like `keras_tuner` were then introduced to refine the process.  

Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naiyakhalid/flood-prediction-dataset](#)  

### Features  
#### Manual Tuning    
- Tuned:  
  - Number of layers and neurons  
  - Learning rates: Static, Step Decay, Cyclical Learning Rate (CLR) with 1cycle scheduler, Exponential Decay  
  - Optimizers: `adam`, `nadam`, `SGD`, `rmsprop`  
  - Batch sizes: 16, 32, 64, 128  
  - Activations: `relu`, `tanh`, `selu`  
  - Initializers: `lecun_normal`, `he_normal`, `glorot_normal`  
- **Pruning**: Reduced network size to improve computational efficiency.  

#### Automated Tuning  
- **keras_tuner**: Used RandomSearch and BayesianOptimization to tune:  
  - `batch_size`  
  - `model__optimizer`  
  - `model__activation`  
  - `model__neurons`  

### Evaluation Metrics  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
- **RÂ² Score**
